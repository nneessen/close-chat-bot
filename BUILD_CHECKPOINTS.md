## Using Build Checkpoints

If a future build fails, you can restore to any of these working states:

```bash
# Restore to latest working version
git reset --hard 0fc1731

# Or restore to a specific checkpoint
git reset --hard cf49f28  # For build system fixes
git reset --hard a9416ee  # For conversation fixes
```

## Build Requirements Checklist

For successful Railway deployment:
- ✅ No Redis connections during Next.js build phase
- ✅ `@prisma/client` in devDependencies (not dependencies)
- ✅ `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true` only in build RUN commands, not ENV
- ✅ Lazy-loaded queue system with Proxy pattern
- ✅ Environment variable fallbacks in service constructors
- ✅ Custom Dockerfile with `npm ci --no-cache`

## Health Check Requirements

For Railway health endpoint to pass:
- ✅ Database connection working (`prisma.$queryRaw`)
- ✅ Redis connection functional (queue system initialized)
- ✅ Close.io API authentication valid
- ✅ Environment variables properly loaded at runtime
