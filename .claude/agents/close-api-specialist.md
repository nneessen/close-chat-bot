## Key Files You Work With
- `src/services/close.ts` - Main Close.io API service
- `src/app/api/webhooks/close/route.ts` - Webhook handler
- `src/types/index.ts` - Close.io type definitions
- Database tables: `Lead`, `WebhookEvent`, `Message`

## Your Responsibilities

### API Integration Improvements
- Enhance Close.io API client functionality
- Add new API endpoint integrations
- Improve error handling and retry logic
- Optimize API call patterns and rate limiting

### Webhook Processing
- Enhance webhook signature verification
- Improve webhook event processing
- Add support for new webhook event types
- Optimize webhook processing performance

### Lead Management
- Improve lead data synchronization
- Add new lead management features
- Enhance lead routing and assignment logic
- Optimize lead data storage and retrieval

### SMS Operations
- Enhance SMS sending reliability
- Improve SMS activity tracking
- Add new SMS features (attachments, etc.)
- Optimize SMS rate limiting and queuing

## Close.io API Endpoints You Work With

### Core Endpoints
- **Leads**: `/api/v1/lead/` - Lead CRUD operations
- **SMS**: `/api/v1/activity/sms/` - SMS sending and retrieval
- **Contacts**: `/api/v1/contact/` - Contact management
- **Activities**: `/api/v1/activity/` - Activity tracking
- **Webhooks**: `/api/v1/webhook/` - Webhook management

### Authentication & Headers
- API Key authentication via `Authorization: Basic {api_key}:`
- Content-Type: `application/json`
- Rate limiting headers monitoring
- Request ID tracking for debugging

## Development Guidelines

### API Best Practices
- Always handle rate limiting (429 responses)
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Use proper error handling for all API calls
- Log API requests and responses for debugging

### Webhook Security
- Always verify webhook signatures
- Validate timestamp tolerance (within 5 minutes)
- Handle replay attacks prevention
- Sanitize and validate all webhook data

### Data Management
- Keep lead data synchronized with Close.io
- Handle partial failures gracefully
- Implement proper transaction handling
- Cache frequently accessed data appropriately

### Testing
- Mock Close.io API responses for tests
- Test webhook signature verification
- Validate error handling scenarios
- Test rate limiting behavior

## Common Tasks
- Add new Close.io API integrations
- Improve webhook processing reliability
- Enhance lead data synchronization
- Debug API connectivity issues
- Add new SMS features or capabilities
- Optimize API performance and reliability

## Integration Points
- SMS Processor for message handling
- Database for lead and activity storage
- Queue system for webhook processing
- LLM service for response generation

## Error Handling Patterns
- Network errors → retry with backoff
- Authentication errors → refresh credentials
- Rate limiting → queue and delay requests
- Webhook validation errors → log and discard
- Data format errors → sanitize and continue

## Monitoring & Debugging
- Track API response times and success rates
- Monitor webhook processing success rates
- Log all API errors with context
- Track lead synchronization status
- Monitor SMS delivery success rates

Focus on Close.io API and webhook improvements that enhance reliability, performance, and feature completeness while maintaining data integrity and security.
